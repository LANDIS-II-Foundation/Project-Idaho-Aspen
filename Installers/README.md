# Project-Idaho-Aspen

# Notes: 

The succession library was altered to allow a clone to persist even if stem mortality occurred.  The code for the library is here: https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Library-Succession/tree/Idaho-aspen/succession-library/trunk

This library replaces the standard succession library in the build for the Biomass Succession library (also unique to the project) here:
